## Issues & Solutions

### ✅ Real-time CLI Output Streaming (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: No visual feedback during Gemini CLI execution, poor user experience
**Solution**:
- Implemented real-time streaming of stdout/stderr from Gemini CLI
- Added WebSocket integration for streaming to chat window
- Created special CLI output styling with terminal-like appearance
- Added color-coded output (green for stdout, red for stderr)
- Implemented console streaming with detailed logging
- Added CLI output container with header and scrollable content
- Enhanced user experience with live progress updates

### ✅ Modern UI with Extension Folder Viewer (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: Need modern UI and better file navigation
**Solution**:
- Completely redesigned UI with dark theme and modern aesthetics
- Added extension folder viewer with file tree navigation
- Implemented color-coded file icons for different file types
- Added click-to-view functionality for extension files
- Integrated browser controls into code panel header
- Enhanced chat interface with modern message bubbles
- Added responsive design for different screen sizes
- Implemented smooth animations and transitions

### ✅ Gemini CLI Integration with Correct Options (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: Need to use correct Gemini CLI options based on official documentation
**Solution**:
- Updated to use `--prompt` instead of `--execute` for providing prompts
- Added `--yolo` flag to automatically accept all changes
- Used `--model gemini-2.0-flash` (default model) instead of deprecated model
- Implemented persistent extension folders per session ID
- Added support for incremental modifications to existing extensions

### ✅ Persistent Extension Folders (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: Need persistent storage for extensions across chat sessions
**Solution**:
- Created `extensions/{session_id}` folder structure
- First generation creates complete extension
- Subsequent generations modify existing files with context
- Maintains extension state across multiple chat interactions
- Provides file list context for incremental changes

### ✅ Gemini CLI Subprocess Execution (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` when calling Gemini CLI
**Solution**:
- Found Gemini CLI installed via npm at `C:\Users\vikra\AppData\Roaming\npm\gemini.cmd`
- Updated subprocess to use full path: `r"C:\Users\vikra\AppData\Roaming\npm\gemini.cmd"`
- Added npm bin directory to PATH environment variable
- Fixed temporary directory cleanup to avoid file access conflicts

### ✅ API Key Configuration (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: `No API_KEY or ADC found` error with Google Generative AI
**Solution**: 
- Migrated to new `google-genai` SDK
- Updated ChatAgent to use `genai.Client(api_key=self.api_key)`
- Fixed environment variable loading in `main.py`
- Updated Python version requirement to >=3.9

### ✅ Gemini CLI Integration (2024-12-19)
**Issue**: `[WinError 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application` and JSON serialization errors
**Solution**:
- Fixed `_call_gemini_cli` to use `gemini` command directly instead of script files
- Updated subprocess call to use proper command structure
- Fixed JSON serialization by converting Extension objects to dictionaries
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### ✅ Browser Automation (2024-12-18)
**Issue**: Browser launching too quickly and closing / 500 Internal Server Error
**Solution**:
- Switched to `launch_persistent_context()` for persistent browser sessions
- Used temporary `user_data_dir` for context management
- Implemented global `_browser_manager` instance for persistence
- Added proper Chrome launch arguments for extension loading

### ✅ Extension Loading (2024-12-18)
**Issue**: Dummy extension not visible after loading
**Solution**:
- Simplified `manifest.json` by removing problematic fields
- Enhanced `content.js` with more prominent visual indicators
- Implemented direct extension loading via `--load-extension` arguments
- Added `--disable-extensions-except` for exclusive loading

### ✅ Environment Variables (2024-12-18)
**Issue**: API keys not being loaded properly
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `load_dotenv()` to load from both root and package `.env` files
- Implemented lazy initialization for ChatAgent to ensure environment variables are loaded first
- Added explicit API key configuration for GenerativeModel
- Ensured both `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` are set consistently

### ✅ Pydantic Validation (2024-12-18)
**Issue**: Validation errors for missing fields
**Solution**:
- Added default values for `id` and `title` fields in models
- Made `session_id` optional in ChatMessage
- Updated route handlers to properly create ChatMessage objects

## Next Steps
1. Test the real-time CLI output streaming
2. Verify extension folder viewer functionality
3. Test incremental extension modification
4. Add more sophisticated extension templates
5. Implement extension validation and testing
6. Add user authentication and session management
7. Integrate with database for persistence
8. Add extension marketplace features
