# Chrome Extension Builder - Project Scratchpad

## Project Overview
Building a Replit-like website for creating Chrome extensions through a chat interface.

## Architecture Components
1. **Chat Interface** - User interaction and extension requirements gathering
2. **Chrome Browser Environment** - Extension loading and testing environment
3. **Background Coding Agent** - Code generation and execution (Gemini CLI)

## Current Status
- [x] Project setup and environment configuration
- [x] Chat interface implementation
- [x] Chrome browser automation setup
- [x] Code generation agent integration
- [x] Extension testing and iteration system (basic)
- [x] Dummy extension created for testing
- [x] Browser automation for loading extensions
- [x] **RESOLVED**: Browser persistence - fixed by using persistent context as per Playwright docs
- [ ] AI integration with chat interface
- [ ] Extension file generation and loading

## Technical Stack Planning
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with modern UI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI for API endpoints
- **Browser Automation**: Playwright for Chrome control
- **Code Generation**: Google Generative AI (Gemini) integration
- **Extension Testing**: Chrome DevTools Protocol

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Set up project structure and dependencies
2. âœ… Create basic chat interface
3. âœ… Implement Chrome browser automation
4. âœ… Integrate code generation agent
5. ðŸ”„ Build extension testing pipeline
6. Test the complete application
7. Add AI integration to chat responses
8. Implement extension file generation

## Progress Log
- [2024-12-19] Project initialized
- [2024-12-19] Planning phase completed
- [2024-12-19] Project structure created
- [2024-12-19] FastAPI application setup
- [2024-12-19] Data models implemented
- [2024-12-19] Chat interface created
- [2024-12-19] API routes implemented
- [2024-12-19] Browser automation setup
- [2024-12-19] AI code generation agent created
- [2024-12-19] HTML template with modern UI created

## Issues & Solutions
- âœ… Fixed pyproject.toml build configuration by adding packages specification
- âœ… Successfully installed all dependencies using uv pip install
- âœ… Playwright browsers installed successfully
- âœ… Application runs and API endpoints are working
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: Browser persistence issue - Chrome extensions require persistent context using `launch_persistent_context()` instead of `launch()` + `new_context()`

## Completed Features
- âœ… Modern chat interface with real-time messaging
- âœ… FastAPI backend with RESTful API endpoints
- âœ… Chrome browser automation using Playwright
- âœ… AI code generation agent using Google Generative AI
- âœ… Extension management system
- âœ… Beautiful, responsive UI with modern design
- âœ… WebSocket support for real-time communication
- âœ… File upload and management for extensions

## Notes
- Keep code modular and maintainable
- Focus on user experience
- Ensure proper error handling
- Track all decisions and implementations
